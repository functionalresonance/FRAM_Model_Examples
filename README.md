* [Prepare Work example](https://github.com/Zerprize-Limited/FMV_Community_Edition/blob/standard/Resources/prepare_work_example.xfmv)  
  Used in the Instructions to explain background and foreground functions. The coupling names are for convenience and not from the original source.

* [Leave Harbour example](https://github.com/Zerprize-Limited/FMV_Community_Edition/blob/standard/Resources/leave_harbour_example.xfmv)  
  Used in the Instructions to demonstrate the FMI - FRAM Model Interpreter. Also used in YouTube video demonstations.  
  First appeared in the book [FRAM: The Functional Resonance Analysis Method](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260189901_FRAM_The_Functional_Resonance_Analysis_Method_Modelling_Complex_Socio-Technical_Systems) by Erik Hollnagel

* [Render Options test](https://github.com/Zerprize-Limited/FMV_Community_Edition/blob/standard/Resources/render_options_test.xfmv)  
  Shown in YouTube video demonstations and used to test render options visual elements. Not a working model.

* [Resilience Potentials 0](https://github.com/Zerprize-Limited/FMV_Community_Edition/blob/standard/Resources/Resilience%20potentials%200.xfmv)  
  [Resilience Potentials 1](https://github.com/Zerprize-Limited/FMV_Community_Edition/blob/standard/Resources/Resilience%20potentials%201.xfmv)  
  [Resilience Potentials 2](https://github.com/Zerprize-Limited/FMV_Community_Edition/blob/standard/Resources/Resilience%20potentials%202.xfmv)  
  Used in YouTube video demonstations to explain advanced FMI options for feedback loops. In three parts with progressive FMI settings.  
  Based on the Resilience Potentials from [Safety-II in Practice](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320059181_Safety-II_in_Practice_Developing_the_Resilience_Potentials) by Erick Hollnagel

* [Cup Noodles](https://github.com/Zerprize-Limited/FMV_Community_Edition/blob/standard/Resources/Cup%20Noodles.xfmv)  
  Commonly used in tutorials as a task for building a first FRAM model. One example, variation is expected among participants.
